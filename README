Set the following in your .bashrc file

export TAXIS_HOME = <path to taxis>

e.g.,

export TAXIS_HOME = /home/praveen/taxis

Set the compiler in src/makefile.in and type "make" inside src directory to compile the code.

You should also add following lines to your .bashrc file

PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/src
PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/utils
PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/extern/bamg-v0.68
export PATH

GMSH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GMSH is a free grid generation tool which you can get from here

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

There are binary versions available for Linux and Mac. In the taxis/examples directories, you will find files with extension "geo" which are gmsh files. To generate a mesh, open it in gmsh

gmsh annulus.geo

and then click on 

Mesh -> 2D -> Save

This creates the mesh file annulus.msh which can be read by taxis. You can also run gmsh from the command line

gmsh -2 annulus.geo

which creates the msh file without starting the gui.

BAMG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BAMG is a 2-d grid generation tool with metric-based mesh adaptation capabilities. BAMG is included inside taxis/extern directory. You need to compile it first. It is setup for linux and should also compile on mac.

cd $TAXIS_HOME/extern/bamg-v0.68
make

This should create executables "bamg" and "drawbdmesh" which are useful.

FAQ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How to see the dual cells ?
A: Run taxis with -d flag which then creates the files tri.dat and dual.dat containing the primal grid of triangles and the dual grid (median or voronoi). The grid can be seen in gnuplot. Start gnuplot and type

gnuplot> plot 'tri.dat' w l
gnuplot> plot 'dual.dat' w l

If you dont want to run the computation but only want to see the grids, give the -p flag also.
