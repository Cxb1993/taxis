Set the following in your .bashrc file

export TAXIS_HOME = <path to taxis>

e.g.,

export TAXIS_HOME = /home/praveen/taxis

Set the compiler in src/makefile.in and type "make" inside src directory to compile the code.

You should also add following lines to your .bashrc file

PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/src
PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/utils
PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/extern/bamg-v0.68
export PATH

GMSH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GMSH is a free grid generation tool which you can get from here

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

There are binary versions available for Linux and Mac. In the taxis/examples directories, you will find files with extension "geo" which are gmsh files. To generate a mesh, open it in gmsh

gmsh annulus.geo

and then click on 

Mesh -> 2D -> Save

This creates the mesh file annulus.msh which can be read by taxis. You can also run gmsh from the command line

gmsh -2 annulus.geo

which creates the msh file without starting the gui.

BAMG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BAMG is a 2-d grid generation tool with metric-based mesh adaptation capabilities. BAMG is included inside taxis/extern directory. You need to compile it first. It is setup for linux and should also compile on mac.

cd $TAXIS_HOME/extern/bamg-v0.68
make

This should create executables "bamg" and "drawbdmesh" which are useful.
