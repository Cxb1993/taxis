Set the following in your .bashrc file

export TAXIS_HOME = <path to taxis>

e.g.,

export TAXIS_HOME = /home/praveen/taxis

Set the compiler in src/makefile.in and type "make" inside src directory to compile the code.

You should also add following lines to your .bashrc file

PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/src
PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/utils
PATH=$PATH:$TAXIS_HOME/extern/bamg-v0.68
export PATH

BAMG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BAMG is included inside extern directory. You need to compile it first. It is setup for linux and should also compile on mac.

cd $TAXIS_HOME/extern/bamg-v0.68
make

This should executables "bamg" and "drawbdmesh" which are useful.
